## > List and describe at least 5 topics that we discussed in class that you know very well. Each description should be at least 1 paragraph with twoto five sentences.
### 1. JS Var: *This the most simplest components of Javascript and easiest to learn. It is used to create and declare a variable, which we always need to do in coding. Ex: var x=67 :33 *
### 2. toFixed(): *So we were tasked on a coding exercise to manage the number of decimal places. I thought it was hard but it was actually so easy. So I always use this whenever it is applicable.*
### 3. if else statement: *Actually this is my most used conditional statement. It was actually easy to use and remember. So whenever I forgot how to do like functions or other statements, I resort to if else statement. I love if else statement sm :33*
### 4. Comparison Operators: *So in my coding exercises I ALWAYS use comparison operators, especially the '=='. Actually I love all the comparison operators. Before learning how it works I thoguht it was really hard to use but actually hese operators are te easiest and most frequently used in coding.*
### 5. Logical Operators: *These are used to confirm or execute a code when met the circumstances. || used for or statements and && is used for only executing the code if both conditions are met. THis two are the most easiest and frequently used in my codings.*


## > List at least 5 topics that you know and can describe but needs further practice/discussion and why.  The why should be per topic listed.  
### 1. while statement: *Actually this is great for coding like print numbers a to b or b to a. But other than that, I find it hard to use on coding exercises. Probably if I practice so much more, I might get used to it.*
### 2. Nested Loop: *I don't think I have ever used this in one of my coding practices. I have trouble with loops so what more if you made many loops T-T. I just don't understand it and always messes up when I ever try to use this.*
### 3. return statement: *Okay so I actually find this useful in simple operations. But other than operations, it is hard for me to use because sometimes it doesn't execute the code actually T-T. Like what if it isnt just a+b, it doesnt return anything. I hope I really understand this soon if we have a coding practice concerning about this.*
### 4. function expression : *So I never use function bu like only once on the 7th exercise I think. It was really hard to use or I'm just too underknowledged on using it. Because sometimes I don't know where to use it with and when I do I think I get it wrong. ;-;*
### 5. argumentlist function declaration: *So like no.4, I don't know if it's th same but I think it's different. This is also confusing for me since if I use interval it just doesn't work or maybe I did something wrong. This is one of my must avoid using in coding actually.*

## > Describe on what will be your plan of action in order to help yourself in understanding further the topics listed on the second items.
### *Okay actually to solve all my problems, I just need to practice more. Like I need to make myself get used to using them in simple exercises until it gets harder and harder. Because practicing them works for me, like the one I thought was hard but after learning and using them in exercises, they were actually fun to use. So maybe I might learn the components I avoid using.*



## > In the activities that were done in class, list at least two that you think were effective and at least two that you think not effective in helping you understand topics in our course and why?
### 1. Guessing Game: *This was really fun to create. I got to practice on input boxes nd the if statements if I can remember. This was the exercise that made me practice on statements and isNaN and what to code if the input is way outside what you are supposed to input. This was my favorite exercise.*
### 2. Even or Odd: *This is also one of the exercises I liked so much. Here I get to practice modulo and I think I also practice switch case here and especially if-else.*
### 1. THE 7th EXERCISE: *Okay so I found the 7th exercise really hard. I think coding it would be a bit easier than debugging it, eitherway both is still hard. Maybe its because of the function and break thingys because I'm not yet good at using them so like the 7th exercise was hard for me.*
### 2. 6th Exercise: *I think this is a great exercise though. But I was probably not used with o muc statements cus at the exrcise I used while, switch case, and if else in just one coding. I just think I'm bad at stackin different statements but I think if I do more exercises regarding his, I'll actually get better.*
